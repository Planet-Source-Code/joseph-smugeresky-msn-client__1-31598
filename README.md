### Description

This code shows you how to connect to the MSN Service. This code also includes a sample/simple client which shows you how everything works together. Along with managing the connection and protocol to MSN, this code will show you how to do the following: Read and Write to the any spot in the registry, Play sounds from a resource file, Superclass controls, Use a collection of classes, Manage multiple connections, Create a smooth flowing Active-X control, Use the MD5 algorithm and much more. This code took me awhile to complete and I was unsure whether to release it. Vote for me if you like what you see. Also, view the readme file included in the zip. Thanks.
